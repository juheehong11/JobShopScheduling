Requirements:
- ortools
- Python 3.6+

Files:

- `solver.py`: where you should be writing your code to solve inputs
- `Task.py`: contains a class that is useful for processing inputs
- Inputs 

Instructions:
1. Make sure ortools is installed
2. Create an outputs folder. Inside the outputs folder, create folders called small, medium, and large.
3. Run solver.py to solve the inputs
    (in the terminal is python3 solver.py)
4. To generate json for gradescope, run python3 prepare_submission.py outputs/ submission.json
5. Outputs should be in their respective folders (outputs/small, outputs/medium, outputs/large)
